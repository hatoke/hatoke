# Welcome to my GitHub page 🎉  

A place where deadlines are imaginary, bugs are eternal, and half-finished projects collect dust like forgotten startup ideas.

## About Me  
- 🚀 **Full-time developer, part-time existential crisis manager.**  
- 🛠️ Building things that break, fixing things that shouldn’t exist,  
  and questioning every career choice along the way.  
- 📉 Proudly navigating the tech industry’s thrilling cycle of  
  **"We're hiring!"** → **"Hiring freeze!"** → **"Mass layoffs!"**  
- 💀 **Sleep? Stability? Health insurance? Never heard of them.**  

## What You’ll Find Here  
- **Code?** Yes.  
- **Good code?** That’s subjective.  
- **Projects I started but never finished?** Plenty.  
- **Hope for a better future?** Haha, good one. I'm living in Turkey and just trying to survive somehow.  

## Fun Facts  
- I could probably fix your bug, but will I? That’s a mystery.  
- Every commit message is a desperate cry for help.  
- If a project breaks, just blame AI. That’s what CEOs do.  

Enjoy your stay. Or don’t. I’m not your boss.
